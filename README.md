## About
*Antimony* is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool from a parallel universe
in which CAD software evolved from Lisp machines rather than drafting tables

This work is a spiritual successor to [kokopelli](https://github.com/mkeeter/kokopelli)
by way of [fabserver](http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu).

For more details and screenshots, look at [this writeup](http://mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony).

## Try it
*Antimony* is in [long-term maintenance mode](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/issues/205#issuecomment-484271273).
It's at a beta level of stability:
solid, but not recommended for mission-critical use.

To get started, there are two suggested options:
- Download a [pre-built application](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/releases) (Mac only)
- [Build from source](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/blob/develop/BUILDING.md) (Mac and Linux)

There is also a community-supported package for [Fedora 22 or later](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/antimony/):
```
dnf install antimony
```
(or `dnf install antimony --enablerepo=updates-testing` to get testing builds)
